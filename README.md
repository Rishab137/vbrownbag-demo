# vbrownbag-demo
This is a Python 3 project that parses a csv file (test.csv) for ips and pings the ips provided to return results. The results are sent to Slack (a messaging platform). 

You can learn more about the Slack API here: https://api.slack.com/

#### Try it out:
1. Modify test.csv with your IP address(es)
2. You will need to modify parseCSV.py on line 26 to a link for your app from Slack API
